To get started, simply invite the bot to your server (or join my test server) and type <span>&#95;</span>help to see the list of commands it can run.
Happy hunting!


List of commands: 
1. _help: It shows the list of available commands that the bot responds to.
2. _profile: Creates/displays user profile depending on if the user already exists.
3. _p: Spawns a new pokemon that you can catch using different kinds of pokeballs, which have different catch rates.
4. _shop: Lets you purchase pokeballs for coins.
5. _bag: Shows you your current coin balance and pokeball inventory.
6. _coins: Shows you your current coin balance.
7. _box: Lets you see what pokemon you have caught, and how many. Pagination is used in case there are a lot of pokemon, and the user can navigate through pages using messages like 'next', 'back', or even the page number. 
8. _dex: Shows a list of all available pokemon in the bot. Again, since there are a total of 151 pokemon currently in the bot, pagination is used. Navigation is the same.
9. _dex {name}: Lets the user look up a specific pokemon's information like their types and their stats, by passing in the pokemon name as an argument. For example, '_dex Pikachu' would show you Pikachu's dex number, its types and its stats.
10. dex {number}: Works similar to the above command. Just takes in the pokemon's dex number instead of their name. Output is the same.
